### Category 1: 2.5" SATA Enterprise SSDs (The Workhorses)

These are the most common, compatible, and often the best value. They are more than fast enough for a boot and OS drive. Look for these series:

- **Intel DC S-Series:** These are legendary for their reliability and are often called the "gold standard" for used server drives.
    
    - **Models to search for:** `Intel DC S4500`, `Intel DC S4510`, `Intel DC S4600`, `Intel DC S4610`.
    - **Why they're great:** They have a perfect balance of performance and extreme endurance, full power-loss protection, and are very mature, stable drives. You can often find a 480GB or 960GB model for a very reasonable price. The S3xxx series (like the S3510 or S3710) are older but still incredibly reliable if the price is right.
- **Micron 5xxx Series:** Micron makes the actual NAND flash for many brands and their own enterprise drives are top-tier.
    
    - **Models to search for:** `Micron 5200 PRO`, `Micron 5300 PRO`. (The "PRO" indicates a read-intensive drive, which is perfect and cost-effective for an OS drive).
    - **Why they're great:** These are slightly more modern than some of the Intel DC series and are known for their power efficiency and solid reliability. They are a fantastic alternative to the Intel drives.
- **Samsung PM/SM Series:** Samsung's datacenter drives are also excellent choices.
    
    - **Models to search for:** `Samsung SM863a`, `Samsung PM883`, `Samsung PM893`.
    - **Why they're great:** They offer competitive performance and are built to the same high standards as Intel and Micron. They are very common in retired enterprise servers.

### Category 2: M.2 NVMe Enterprise SSDs (For Higher Performance)

If your motherboard has an M.2 slot and you want higher sequential speeds, these are great options. Note that enterprise M.2 drives are less common than SATA, but deals can be found.

- **Samsung PM-Series:** These are OEM datacenter NVMe drives.
    - **Models to search for:** `Samsung PM983`, `Samsung PM9A3`.
    - **Why they're great:** They offer incredible NVMe performance combined with datacenter-grade endurance and power-loss protection. The PM983 is often the sweet spot for value on the used market.
