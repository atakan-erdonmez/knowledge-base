Open-source successor to ElastiSearch.

In DynamoDB, queries only exist by primary key or indexes.

With OpenSearch, you can search any field, even partially matches. It is common to use it as a complement to another database.

- Two modes: managed or serverless
- Does *not* natively support SQL (can be enabled via plugin)
- Ingestion from Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS IoT, and CloudWatch logs
- Comes with OpenSearch Dashboards
