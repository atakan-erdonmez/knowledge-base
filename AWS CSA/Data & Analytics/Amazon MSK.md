Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka

It is an alternative to Amazon Kinesis, fully managed Kafka on AWS

- Allows you to create, update, delete clusters
- Creates & manages Kafka broker nodes & Zookeeper nodes for you
- Deploy in VPC, multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA)
- Automatic recovery for common failures
- Stored on EBS volumes

### MSK Serverless
Run Kafka on MSK without managing the capacity. Automatically provision resources and scale
