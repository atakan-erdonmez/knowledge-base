Sometimes you want control over the EC2 Instance placement strategy
That strategy can be defined using placement groups

When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:

- **Cluster** — clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone
- **Spread** — spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) – critical applications
- **Partition** — spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
