# For Loop

```python
all_fruits = ['apple', 'peach', 'banana']
for fruit in all_fruits:
	print(fruit)
```

## In Range Loop

```python
for number in range (1,10)
	print(number)
```

Number b (10 in example) is not included

If you want to include a step, you can add a third number:
```python
for number in range (1,100,5)
# This will increment in 5
```

# While Loop
```python
while true_condition:
	do_this()
```
