SAM grants rights to a network to execute specific processes.

The access rights themselves are managed by Access Control Entries (ACE) in Access Control Lists (ACL). The ACLs contain ACEs that define which users, groups, or processes have access to a file or to execute a process, for example.

The permissions to access a securable object are given by the security descriptor, classified into two types of ACLs: the `Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)` or `System Access Control List (SACL)`. Every thread and process started or initiated by a user goes through an authorization process. An integral part of this process is access tokens, validated by the Local Security Authority (LSA). In addition to the SID, these access tokens contain other security-relevant information. Understanding these functionalities is an essential part of learning how to use and work around these security mechanisms during the privilege escalation phase.

## User Account Control (UAC)

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a security feature in Windows to prevent malware from running or manipulating processes that could damage the computer or its contents. There is the Admin Approval Mode in UAC, which is designed to prevent unwanted software from being installed without the administrator's knowledge or to prevent system-wide changes from being made. Surely you have already seen the consent prompt if you have installed a specific software, and your system has asked for confirmation if you want to have it installed. Since the installation requires administrator rights, a window pops up, asking you if you want to confirm the installation. With a standard user who has no rights for the installation, execution will be denied, or you will be asked for the administrator password. This consent prompt interrupts the execution of scripts or binaries that malware or attackers try to execute until the user enters the password or confirms execution. To understand how UAC works, we need to know how it is structured and how it works, and what triggers the consent prompt. The following diagram, adapted from the source [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works), illustrates how UAC works.
