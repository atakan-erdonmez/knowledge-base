Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature called the `execution policy`, which attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The possible policies are:

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AllSigned`|All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted.|
|`Bypass`|No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.|
|`Default`|This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers.|
|`RemoteSigned`|Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.|
|`Restricted`|This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked.|
|`Undefined`|No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used.|
|`Unrestricted`|This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone.|

Below is an example of the current execution policy for all scopes.

  Graphical User Interface

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

The execution policy is not meant to be a security control that restricts user actions. A user can easily bypass the policy by either typing the script contents directly into the PowerShell window, downloading and invoking the script, or specifying the script as an encoded command. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the proper rights) or setting the execution policy for the current process scope (which can be done by almost any user as it does not require a configuration change and will only be set for the duration of the user's session).

Below is an example of changing the execution policy for the current process (session).

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
```

We can now see that the execution policy has been changed.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb>  Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process          Bypass
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```
