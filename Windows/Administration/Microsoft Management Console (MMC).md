The MMC can be used to group snap-ins, or administrative tools, to manage hardware, software, and network components within a Windows host. It has been around since Windows Server 2000 and runs on all Windows versions. We can also use MMC to create custom tools and distribute them to users. MMC works with the concept of snap-ins, allowing administrators to create a customized console with only the administrative tools needed to manage several services. These snap-ins can be added to manage both local and remote systems.
