get-wmiobject
We can use the [Get-WmiObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject?view=powershell-5.1) [cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7) to find information about the operating system. This cmdlet can be used to get instances of WMI classes or information about available WMI classes. There are a variety of ways to find the version and build number of our system. We can easily obtain this information using the `win32_OperatingSystem` class, which shows that we are on a Windows 10 host, build number 19041.
	Some other useful classes that can be used with `Get-WmiObject` are `Win32_Process` to get a process listing, `Win32_Service` to get a listing of services, and `Win32_Bios` to get [Basic Input/Output System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) (`BIOS`) information. The BIOS is firmware installed on a computer's motherboard that controls the computer's essential functions, such as power management, input/output interfaces, and system configuration. We can use the `ComputerName` parameter to get information about remote computers. `Get-WmiObject` can be used to start and stop services on local and remote computers, and more.
