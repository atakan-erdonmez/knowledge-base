## Event Log Categories and Types

The main four log categories include application, security, setup, and system. Another type of category also exists called `forwarded events`.

|Log Category|Log Description|
|---|---|
|System Log|The system log contains events related to the Windows system and its components. A system-level event could be a service failing at startup.|
|Security Log|Self-explanatory; these include security-related events such as failed and successful logins, and file creation/deletion. These can be used to detect various types of attacks that we will cover in later modules.|
|Application Log|This stores events related to any software/application installed on the system. For example, if Slack has trouble starting it will be recorded in this log.|
|Setup Log|This log holds any events that are generated when the Windows operating system is installed. In a domain environment, events related to Active Directory will be recorded in this log on domain controller hosts.|
|Forwarded Events|Logs that are forwarded from other hosts within the same network.|


## Event Types

There are five types of events that can be logged on Windows systems:

|Type of Event|Event Description|
|---|---|
|Error|Indicates a major problem, such as a service failing to load during startup, has occurred.|
|Warning|A less significant log but one that may indicate a possible problem in the future. One example is low disk space. A Warning event will be logged to note that a problem may occur down the road. A Warning event is typically when an application can recover from the event without losing functionality or data.|
|Information|Recorded upon the successful operation of an application, driver, or service, such as when a network driver loads successfully. Typically not every desktop application will log an event each them they start, as this could lead to a considerable amount of extra "noise" in the logs.|
|Success Audit|Recorded when an audited security access attempt is successful, such as when a user logs on to a system.|
|Failure Audit|Recorded when an audited security access attempt fails, such as when a user attempts to log in but types their password in wrong. Many audit failure events could indicate an attack, such as Password Spraying.|

## Event Severity Levels

Each log can have one of five severity levels associated with it, denoted by a number:

|Severity Level|Level #|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Verbose|5|Progress or success messages.|
|Information|4|An event that occurred on the system but did not cause any issues.|
|Warning|3|A potential problem that a sysadmin should dig into.|
|Error|2|An issue related to the system or service that does not require immediate attention.|
|Critical|1|This indicates a significant issue related to an application or a system that requires urgent attention by a sysadmin that, if not addressed, could lead to system or application instability.|

## Elements of a Windows Event Log

The Windows Event Log provides information about hardware and software events on a Windows system. All event logs are stored in a standard format and include the following elements:

- `Log name`: As discussed above, the name of the event log where the events will be written. By default, events are logged for `system`, `security`, and `applications`.
- `Event date/time`: Date and time when the event occurred
- `Task Category`: The type of recorded event log
- `Event ID`: A unique identifier for sysadmins to identify a specific logged event
- `Source`: Where the log originated from, typically the name of a program or software application
- `Level`: Severity level of the event. This can be information, error, verbose, warning, critical
- `User`: Username of who logged onto the host when the event occurred
- `Computer`: Name of the computer where the event is logged

There are many Event IDs that an organization can monitor to detect various issues. In an Active Directory environment, [this list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/appendix-l--events-to-monitor) includes key events that are recommended to be monitored for to look for signs of a compromise. [This](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/) searchable database of Event IDs is worth perusing to understand the depth of logging possible on a Windows system.

## Windows Event Log Technical Details

The Windows Event Log is handled by the `EventLog` services. On a Windows system, the service's display name is `Windows Event Log`, and it runs inside the service host process [svchost.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svchost.exe). It is set to start automatically at system boot by default. It is difficult to stop the EventLog service as it has multiple dependency services. If it is stopped, it will likely cause significant system instability. By default, Windows Event Logs are stored in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs` with the file extension `.evtx`.

We can interact with the Windows Event log using the [Windows Event Viewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Viewer) GUI application via the command line utility [wevtutil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/wevtutil), or using the [Get-WinEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent?view=powershell-7.3) PowerShell cmdlet. Both `wevtutil` and `Get-WinEvent` can be used to query Event Logs on both local and remote Windows systems via cmd.exe or PowerShell.
