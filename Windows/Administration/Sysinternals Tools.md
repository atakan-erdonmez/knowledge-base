The [SysInternals Tools suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals) is a set of portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows systems (for the most part without requiring installation). The tools can be either downloaded from the Microsoft website or by loading them directly from an internet-accessible file share by typing `\\live.sysinternals.com\tools` into a Windows Explorer window.

For example, we can run procdump.exe directly from this share without downloading it directly to disk.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> \\live.sysinternals.com\tools\procdump.exe -accepteula

ProcDump v9.0 - Sysinternals process dump utility

Monitors a process and writes a dump file when the process exceeds the
specified criteria or has an exception.

```

The suite includes tools such as `Process Explorer`, an enhanced version of `Task Manager`, and `Process Monitor`, which can be used to monitor file system, registry, and network activity related to any process running on the system. Some additional tools are TCPView, which is used to monitor internet activity, and PSExec, which can be used to manage/connect to systems via the SMB protocol remotely.

These tools can be useful for penetration testers to, for example, discover interesting processes and possible privilege escalation paths as well as for lateral movement.
