[Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) is a part of the Sysinternals tool suite. This tool can show which handles and DLL processes are loaded when a program runs. Process Explorer shows a list of currently running processes, and from there, we can see what handles the process has selected in one view or the DLLs and memory-swapped files that have been loaded in another view. We can also search within the tool to show which processes tie back to a specific handle or DLL. The tool can also be used to analyze parent-child process relationships to see what child processes are spawned by an application and help troubleshoot any issues such as orphaned processed that can be left behind when a process is terminated.
