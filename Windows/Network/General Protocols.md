| `SMB`        | [SMB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/4287490c-602c-41c0-a23e-140a1f137832) provides Windows hosts with the capability to share resources, files, and a standard way of authenticating between hosts to determine if access to resources is allowed. For other distros, SAMBA is the open-source option.                                     |
| `Netbios`    | [NetBios](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1001.txt) itself isn't directly a service or protocol but a connection and conversation mechanism widely used in networks. It was the original transport mechanism for SMB, but that has since changed. Now it serves as an alternate identification mechanism when DNS fails. Can also be known as NBT-NS (NetBIOS name service).           |
| `LDAP`       | [LDAP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511) is an `open-source` cross-platform protocol used for `authentication` and `authorization` with various directory services. This is how many different devices in modern networks can communicate with large directory structure services such as `Active Directory`.                                                                |
| `LLMNR`      | [LLMNR](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4795) provides a name resolution service based on DNS and works if DNS is not available or functioning. This protocol is a multicast protocol and, as such, works only on local links ( within a normal broadcast domain, not across layer three links).                                                                                 |
| `DNS`        | [DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) is a common naming standard used across the Internet and in most modern network types. DNS allows us to reference hosts by a unique name instead of their IP address. This is how we can reference a website by "WWW.google.com" instead of "8.8.8.8". Internally this is how we request resources and access from a network. |
| `HTTP/HTTPS` | [HTTP/S](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818) HTTP and HTTPS are the insecure and secure way we request and utilize resources over the Internet. These protocols are used to access and utilize resources such as web servers, send and receive data from remote sources, and much more.                                                                                        |
| `Kerberos`   | [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network level authentication protocol. In modern times, we are most likely to see it when dealing with Active Directory authentication when clients request tickets for authorization to use domain resources.                                                                                                                      |
| `WinRM`      | [WinRM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) Is an implementation of the WS-Management protocol. It can be used to manage the hardware and software functionalities of hosts. It is mainly used in IT administration but can also be used for host enumeration and as a scripting engine.                                                                 |
| `RDP`        | [RDP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-plan-access-from-anywhere) is a Windows implementation of a network UI services protocol that provides users with a Graphical interface to access hosts over a network connection. This allows for full UI use to include the passing of keyboard and mouse input to the remote host.    |
| `SSH`        | [SSH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251) is a secure protocol that can be used for secure host access, transfer of files, and general communication between network hosts. It provides a way to securely access hosts and services over insecure networks.                                                                                                             |
